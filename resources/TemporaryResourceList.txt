Math resources
---------------
TODO: These resources need to be studied for structure and viability and annotated.

CPM ------------------------------
https://cpm.org/
CPM (College Preparatory Mathematics) is an organization that provides math curriculum to school departments.  They have opened a list of their resources to the public in response to COVID, but their business model seems to be centered around the sale of a host of resources to parents and students and curricula for institutions.  The free resources they uploaded are *not* licensed for redistribution.  I am not sure that we can use any of what they have.

Khan academy is probably the one that's been "in the game" the longest, when it comes to free online learning.  As a response to COVID, they've uploaded parent and teacher resources and daily schedules for kids 2-18.

Alison has coursework for a massive wealth of topics. They monetize by offering to sell cerificates and placing ads on the site. They also require adobe flash to work.  I am not confident in the value added here, and I think that other places will ask less and give more.

These guys seem to be stabbing at what we're trying to accomplish (aggregating a number of other resources).
