# Culture

Praxis is going to live or die on the culture of those that use it.  Here, I want to do some steering.

# Components of an effective educational culture

1. Grit (Duckworth)

Perseverance and passion for long-term goals.  We want mentors that have experience going through a long-term gauntlet of adversity and coming out the other side successful, as the tendancy to do this can be taught.

Iteration, tenacity, 

2. Encouragement (Mitra)

There should be no room for belittling people on what they do not yet know or berating people for asking questions.  The culture should see such behavior as the weakness of an individual who does not have a firm enough grasp on a topic to lead others in it's instruction.  

3. Embrace Failure

A recognition of process should be baked into the materials for recruiting and training people on Praxis methods.  Part of this is an explicit acknowledgement that failure is an indispensable part of the learning process.  To this end, failure should be celebrated, without irony, in the same manner as success.

Fail-forward, process-oriented

4. Drop the ego

The timbre of the comraderie that should be encouraged within the Praxis community should make those in the leading roles and those in the following roles feel as equals.  There should be no room for a mentor that has nothing to learn (as it is assumed there is never anybody who has nothing to learn.)  There should be no room for "smartier-than-thou" in this movement.

5. DIY (working title)

Not quite DIY as in, do-something-you'd-otherwise-pay-for.  In this context, there should be an understanding that if you see a flaw somewhere, you should only drop it off with someone else if for some reason you are incapable of remedying it yourself.  This ties in to ownership.  On the flip side, when designing systems (like breadcrumbs, lesson plans, learning materials), Praxis practitioners should make efforts to make it easy for others to contribute fixes.

NOTE: This sort of ties into one of the more foundational philosophies of mine in this thing;  Content should be laid down quick and dirty, and then iterated on and further developed.  By splitting the burden up thusly, people will be more motivated to start these projects, and more people can have ownership of the process, driving deeper engagement.

6. Ownership

Anyone engaged in this project should be able to take ownership of a piece of it.  At all levels there should be ways for individuals to contribute to the overall wellbeing of the project. 

7. Imperfectionists

There is too much to learn and too much to do to have perfectionist expectations.  Following this logic, we fully expect things to be shipped with bugs { breadcrumbs, lesson plans, etc. } The appropriate response of someone finding a flaw should be to simply fix it (or, if they can't, to helpfully mention; "found one!").  The proper response of a content creator who has been told of a bug should be: "hey, you found one!  Thanks!".

8. Eager Onboarding, or; Radical Inclusion

	The more, the merrier.  These systems are designed to scale, and to benefit from scale.  The more vibrant the ecosystem the more robust will be the products.  This may clash on some level with how tight we want to keep the culture, so it must be paid close attention to when steering, but we want as many people on this as feasible at any given stage.  The more individuals buy in, the larger the base of editors and contributors, the better the content.  
	To this end, systems should by their very structure corral individuals into contributing to what is already there rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.  This will take some doing.  Things to keep an eye on; conflicting motivations (i.e. sponsored content) will pose a threat here.  Ego will pose a threat here.
