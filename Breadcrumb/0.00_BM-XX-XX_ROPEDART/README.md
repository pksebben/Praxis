# Overview
This breadcrumb is for those who want to learn or improve skill in the Rope Dart.  It contains references to videos, communities, and bits of guidance that were hard to locate in the wild.
If you're just starting out, the roadmap is the first step by design.  Otherwise, feel free to peruse at your leisure.


# Terms of use
As a Praxis Breadcrumb, you agree to a couple of very forgiving terms by using this document.  
1. Most importantly, if you are using this as a guide and working through it, you agree to contribute to it's development.  I don't ask that you reinvent the wheel, just that if you find any information not referenced here, you add it to the repository.  If you're unfamiliar with the concept of a Praxis Breadcrumb, please refer to Praxis.px.  It lays out the point of writing these and the cultural code that allows Breadcrumbs to become more than just how-to guides.  There are plenty of those and this would be pointless if that's all it did.
2. No monetizing the content!  This is less a guideline and more of a **legal issue**, as these breadcrumbs are protected by {WHAT LICENSE ARE WE GOING TO USE TO BOOTSTRAP??}.  This means that you can do whatever you like with this information and spread it wherever you like (actually, please do that!), but you can't use it to make money and you can't build on it without including the original license.  This is to protect free and open access to information.
3. You commit to the cultural code of the praxis project. This means some pretty obvious stuff (Don't be a douchebag, racist, elitist, asshole of other garden variety, etc.).  It *also* means some less obvious stuff, like respect those who know less than you, and be relentlessly curious, and commit to the tenets of informational socialism.  These are all things that you can be proud of doing so just do them.  Or go play somewhere else.
