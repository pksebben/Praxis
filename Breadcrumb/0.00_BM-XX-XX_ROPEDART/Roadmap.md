# Roadmap
Greetings!  This roadmap is for those just starting out who want guidance on where to begin.

# Getting Gear
The very first thing you're going to want to do is equip yourself with a dart.  There are a few options:

1. Make one yourself

   It's pretty easy.  Should take at most an hour and some frustration.

2. Buy one

   They're not too, too expensive.
   You can get them on amazon, or support the artists who handcraft them at one of these places:

   1. Fire darts
   
      I wouldn't start with these.  Mostly because as a beginner, you're going to beat the hell out of your dart head, and fire wick is expensive.
	  
   2. Silk darts
  
      Again, these are great for practice, but you're going to destroy the first dart head you use.
	  
   3. Practice head
   
      These are made out of rubber or plastic and are durable and cheap.  I recommend starting here.
	  
   4. LED Dart
   
      These are great, especially if your friends like flashy lights.  But, again, you are going to DESTROY your first dart, and these run north of $100.  Get them once you know what you're doing
	  
   5. Actual, dart, dart.
   
      I do not own one myself so I can't reflect on them, but my instincts tell me that while you're learning, it's a bad idea to have a blade at the business end.  Up to you.

Remember, once you get the bug, buying another dart for a different purpose is going to seem cheap.  The most expensive are around $100 and you'll get more than that out of them in value.


# If you've never picked up a dart in your life
My advice is this: anyone can do this.  It takes practice, but the practice is a *ton of fun*.  So let's get you started;

1. Begin by watching a couple of videos.

   This one by flow mayhem is an amazing starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgbW53OZjwg

   Watch that and start getting a feel for the dart, how to hold it, etc.  Flow will guide you through that part.

2. Watch more stuff

   Check out some of flow mayhem's more showy stuff.  Take a look at the shaolin video (all in the resources section). Not to do the stuff in them immediately, but to get inspired as to what you're going to be able to do eventually.

3. Practice a ton

   I recommend finding wireless headphones (or a speaker, if your neighbors are like, super cool) and listening to something with a beat while I practice. I find keeping the dart in a rhythm helps internalize timing really well, which is the foundation for most of what rope darting is.
