# Breadcrumb methodology

The actual meat of a breadcrumb should take on a particular structure, and there will be ways of making them that are better and more efficient.  These methods should be provided as part of every breadcrumb.  A guide to making the guides, if you will.

# Techniques

 - Mark the plot, then build the house
 
   What I'm referring to here, is that when you're building out the list of resources in a breadcrumb, you will know where the reference goes before you know what the reference is.  For example, let's say you are making a breadcrumb about baking. In your cake recipe, you notice that there's a lack of instruction for mixing methods.  Your crumb at this point might look like this:
   
   Baking a cake breadcrumb
   
   - #Ref Recipe for a cake
   - #Ref How ovens work / basic baking physics
   - #Ref { required:mixing methods } 
   
 ...Then, you go find yourself the information you are looking for and put it in the {} tag you left as a placeholder.
 
 Let's say that you don't know what the next thing you need is.  You're writing code and you don't quite understand a bug you encountered.  
	 
	 
# What is the language of a breadcrumb?

This is something I am struggling with, due to it's abstract nature.  Are we trying to teach specific skills or develop understanding?
