# 0.00_BM-XX-XX_Firewall
This is an Atomic Breadcrumb for learning how a firewall works and how to configure and manage a firewall.

# Structure
Breadcrumb information is stored in Crumb.md
My own notes are in `Notes/BM_Notes.md`.  They are not necessary to get learning and contributing to the breadcrumb, and I advise anyone crumbing this crumb create their own notes as they append the crumb itself.
