# Praxis

Welcome to the Praxis project!  Our goal is to decentralize learning by returning to the apprenticeship model - we belive that the current educational paradigm (that is, 30 monkeys per teacher, all under the oppressive umbrella of higher academia), does not work for everyone.  We might even go so far as to say that it has left a ton of talent and intellect in the cultural dust, as it is geared towards creating good employees, and not necessarily good thinkers and doers.  

# Who we are

Folks who have been failed by the current system.  We went to school, fell a little bit behind, and quickly understood that it was going to cost us too much money and time to learn what we wanted to learn.  We have decided to help each other out instead of just quitting, and that's what Praxis is designed to do.

# What we do

There are a couple of key problems that traditional education does actually solve.  We don't want to give them our money or time, so we're going to solve them ourselves.  These include, but are not limited to:

  - Guidance.  All endeavors are assisted best by people who know them well.  We intend to connect people who are learning with people who are learned.
  - Resources.  Used to be, books and information were costly and difficult to find.  Now, they're just difficult to find.  We want to aggregate learning resources and provide them to those who need them, whether or not they're part of the project.
  - Motivation.  Learning is hard, and traditionally, folks have kept at it because they need to justify the debt they enter by going to college to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.  We're more about the carrot and less about the stick, but it is still important to support each other emotionally and keep each other honest in terms of continuing to learn.  
  
# How we do it

Mentorship and community.  We pair up with people who are in a place to dedicate time to learning something we know, and we help them.  The process, at the moment, is something we're actively working to refine, but it is best thought of as an old-timey apprenticeship.  You commit to learning a thing, and your mentor commits to assisting you along the way.  One difference is that done our way, the student leads - deciding what to work on while the teacher assists with the power of greater experience. This process is multileveled - as we are all students, those who are mentoring should be also learning from other mentors.  The mother teaches the maiden, and the crone teaches the mother.
